        <h1>History</h1>
        <div class="rectangle">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">Music</a> is the art of arranging sounds in time through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre.
            It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. 
            General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch, rhythm, dynamics, and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture.

        <h1>Genres</h1>
        <div class="rectangle">
            Music can be divided into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">genres</a> (e.g., country music) and genres can be further divided 
            into subgenres (e.g., alternative country and country pop are two of the many country subgenres), 
            although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial.

        <h1>Composition</h1>
        <div class="rectangle">
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">"Composition"</a> is the act or practice of creating a song, an instrumental music piece, a work with both singing and instruments, 
            or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of music notation, 
            such as a sheet music "score", which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing,
            which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression.

        <h1>Theory</h1>
        <div class="rectangle">
            Music <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music">theory</a> encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the 
            language and notation of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the parameters or elements of music â€“ rhythm, harmony (harmonic function), 
            melody, structure, form, and texture. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.[10] People who study these properties are known 
            as music theorists, and they typically work as professors in colleges, universities, and music conservatories. Some have applied acoustics, human physiology, and psychology to the 
            explanation of how and why music is perceived. Music theorists publish their research in music theory journals and university press books.
